# Sequential learning and control: Targeted exploration for robust performance
This repository contains code for the work "Sequential learning and control: Targeted exploration for robust performance". The details of this work can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10601334) or [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07995)

# Simulations

1. Install [CVX](https://cvxr.com/cvx/) for MATLAB
2. The [main script](main_tacredo_exploration.m) contains links to and instructions for all the dependent scripts.
3. Run the [main script](main_tacredo_exploration.m) under the desired conditions (per section, if required).
4. Collect data and use a scipt similar to the [plotting script](plot10_onlyD11.m) to visualize the results.
